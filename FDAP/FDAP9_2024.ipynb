    "It is mainly used for searching and manipulating text strings. In simple words, you can easily search the pattern and replace them with the matching pattern with the help of regular expression.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In regular expressions, if a character is directly specified, it represents an exact match. <code>\\d</code> can match a digit, and <code>\\w</code> can match a letter or digit, <code>.</code> can match any character.\n",
    "* <code>'00\\\\d'</code> can match <code>'007'</code> but not <code>'00A'</code>\n",
    "* <code>'\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d'</code> can match <code>'010'</code>\n",
    "* <code>'\\\\w\\\\w\\\\d'</code> can match <code>'py3'</code>\n",
    "* <code>'py.'</code> can match <code>'pyc'</code>, <code>'pyo'</code>, <code>'py!'</code>, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "To match complicated strings, we use certain symbols within a regular expression. <code>*</code> represents any number of characters (including zero), <code>+</code> represents at least one character, <code>?</code> represents zero or one character, <code>{n}</code> represents exactly n characters, and <code>{n,m}</code> represents a range of n to m characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a complex example: <code>\\d{3,4}\\s+\\d{3,8}</code>. Let's break it down from left to right:\n",
    "* <code>\\d{3}</code> matches three digits, for example, <code>'010'</code>\n",
    "* <code>\\s</code> can match a whitespace character (including tabs and other whitespace characters), so <code>\\\\s+</code> represents at least one whitespace character, for example, matching <code>' '</code>, <code>'&nbsp;&nbsp;'</code>, and so on\n",
    "* <code>\\d{3,8}</code> matches 3 to 8 digits, for example, <code>'1234567'</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, the above regular expression can match phone numbers with an area code separated by any number of spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to match a number like <code>'010-12345'</code>? Since <code>'-'</code> is a special character, we need to **escape** it with a backslash in the regular expression, so it becomes <code>'\\d{3}\\\\-\\d{3,8}'</code>."

    "* <code>[a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_]*</code> can match a string that starts with a letter, followed by any number of digits, letters, or underscores. This represents a valid Python variable;\n",
    "* <code>[a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_]{0,19}</code> further restricts the variable's length to be 1-20 characters (first character + up to 19 additional characters).\n",
    "* <code>A|B</code> can match A or B, so <code>(P|p)ython</code> can match <code>'Python'</code> or <code>'python'</code>.\n",
    "* <code>^</code> represents the beginning of a line, <code>^\\d</code> means it must start with a digit.\n",
