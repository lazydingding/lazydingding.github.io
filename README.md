If you are an undergraduate or graduate student looking for some research assistant work, please email me with a brief email statement of your interests. Most of my research involve empirical work and my programming language of choice is python<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/20/000000/python--v1.png">, but I also have uses for students with no programming experience as well.
